You are a Linux or Mac user and don't want to keep your Windows partition anymore?
The only thing that is stopping you from taring it down is the "Activate Windows" watermark which you so desperatley want to keep?

You are not alone. Don't worry. People on GitHub got your back!

There is a Linux version [github.com/MrGlockenspiel/activate-linux](https://github.com/MrGlockenspiel/activate-linux) which is charmingly
beautiful.

Finally you can throw away your Windows partition and still enjoy the lifestyle of using a non activated operating system.
