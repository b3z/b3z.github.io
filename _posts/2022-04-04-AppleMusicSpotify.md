**TL;DR**


--- 

A couple months back I switched from Spotify to Apple Music just to try it out. So I have used Spotify for a couple years and Apple Music for three months now.
So this is the result of my comparison.

## Audio quality
Spotify offers a maximum streaming quality of `320 kbit/s` which is the bitrate of a MP3-File.
Apple Music on the other hand is capable of `24bit/192kHz` which is the equivalent of `9216 kbit/s`.
This is much closer to studio quality than the `320 kbit/s`.

In terms of audio quality is Apple Music clearly better. Not only on paper but you can hear a difference.

## Library & Recommendations
So the libraries are pretty equal. Spotify also lists covered songs but I don't care much about those.
Then there are Spotify exclusive podcasts. That's indeed an anoyance
